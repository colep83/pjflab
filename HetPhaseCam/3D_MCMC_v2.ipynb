    "This code was written as a method to optimize a FLIR BlackFlyS IR camera which the LIGO Lab at the University of Florida is using with two 1064nm lasers to test and develop the concept of a heterodyne phase camera. \n",
    "\n",
    "The optimization method developed for this purpose can loosely be defined as a type of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The 'Monte Carlo' aspect involves seeding the parameter space with many random starting points. The 'Markov Chain\" aspect involves an 'intelligent' random walk, wherein for each random step the chain can move to, the chain's decision engine must decide if moving to the new position will decrease the figure of merit (FOM) in the case of minimization. If the new position does decrease the FOM, the chain continues on its quest for lower values of the FOM. If it helps to visualize, I like to think of the chains as snakes; hence I have named functions with the snake theme. Another way to visualize what is occuring is to watch the short movie hosted in the same repository with this script (https://github.com/pfulda/pjflab/blob/master/Simulation_Output/MCMC_optimization_toy_model_2D_video.mp4) which shows the MCMC minimization for an analytical function and small parameter space. \n",

    "For a user of this tool, I am providing some tips and general information about the method and the results you can expect:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) In a rather unorthodox manner, the FOM was chosen to be the minimum value of $-<SNR>^2$ (negated average 'amplitude-SNR' squared). Why?:  \n",
    "  \n",
    "a) Negated because a previous model used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method was a minimizaiton\n",
    "\n",
    "b) The averaging is the average value of SNR in a single pixel over a 10x10 cluster of pixels through a times series of 400 images (i.e. sum SNR in all 100 pixels, then divide by 100)\n",
    "\n",
    "c) We square the 'amplitude-SNR' so that we have 'power-SNR'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) This method assumes the parameter space is 3D; with the three dimensions being camera exposure time, laser power, and camera gain setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) The laser power, which is specified by 'power1' in the function BeamChoice is the power in watts provided to each of the simulated laser beams, not the total power incident on the camera.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Exposure time has units of seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Gain has units of dB.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) There are certain parameters which the user should be aware of and change if desired. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) the numpy arrays which determine the length and values on each of the parameter space's dimensions ('exp_bounds', 'pwr_bounds', 'gain_bounds')\n",
    "\n",
    "b) the python list objects which contain the allowed step sizes ('StepSet_exp', 'StepSet_pwr', StepSet_gain')\n",
    "\n",
    "c) 'NumPaths' is an input to 'CreateAllPaths' and determines the number of snakes you want to search your parameter space and 'Numberiterations' is an input to 'CreateAllPaths' which determines the number of steps each snake is 'allowed' to take (this is a tradeoff, snakes which start in 'poor' locations in the parameter space should be terminated quickly to reduce unnecesary computational expense (small value of 'Numberiterations' desired), but you would want snakes seeded in a 'good' location to have enough step opportunities to reach the global minimum (large value of 'Numberiterations' desired)).\n",
    "\n",
    "d) The variable 'delta' in 'SnakeChoice' allows for new step FOM values to be close to, but not exactly less than the current position. This is useful for our computation of the FOM because each computation does not yield the exact same value (i.e. there is always some non-zero standard deviation).\n",
    "\n",
    "e) In the function 'CreateFullPath_i' there is a line of code, 'if (-0.5 < (Zvec[index_i]-Zvec[index_i+1]) < 0.5):'. The two values, -0.5 and 0.5, can be changed to any values you desire. These are specified to make sure the snake is making sufficient progress in its minimization trajectory. If the difference between two FOM step calculations (i.e. Zvec values) is not between these bounds, then the path will terminate.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) The primary function for calculating the FOM subject to different input parameters is 'ParamChoices_SNR'.\n",
    "\n",
    "8) The primary function for the MCMC method 'decision-making' is 'SnakeChoice'.\n",
    "\n",
    "9) The primary function to run the entire MCMC optimization is 'CreateAllPaths'.\n",
    "\n",
    "10) The primary function for quick data analysis of the optimization is 'SNRAnalysis'.\n",
    "\n",
    "11) The chunk of code beneath 'SNRAnalysis' is a diagnostic to show the standard deviation of computing the FOM many times with the same input parameters. So for instance, after running the method with 'CreateAllPaths', and retrieving the parameter inputs from 'SNRAnalysis', you could put those parameter inputs into the stddev calculation code to have a value of the standard deviation you can expect for the minimum FOM calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "12) The HPC.py package was built by Mauricio Diaz-Ortiz at UF, with later development by other members of the UF LIGO group. For questions on the package either email mdiazort@ufl.edu or see the Github account which hosts HPC.py, https://github.com/Mo-Rice/hpc_sim.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have questions on this method, you can contact me at https://kadenjloring.wordpress.com/.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope this is of some use to you!"
