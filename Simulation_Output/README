This folder is meant to store small and important computed output of simulations or other scripts from the HPC project. 
For instance, the first saved item is an html video demonstrating the performance of the MCMC optimization method on the 2D toy model parameter space. 
I needed an online repository to store the video so that I could include it in the actual camera MCMC optimization script.
